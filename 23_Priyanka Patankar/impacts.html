            <h3 style="color:navy">Impact of COVID-19 on education system:</h3>
            <p> Impact of COVID-19 on education system In order to control the spread of the novel coronavirus, state governments started the closure of schools and colleges across the country. It was somewhere announced in the second week of March as a temporary measure to avoid the crowd. Initially, for a month closure of schools was announced by the government but gradually the time of closure was extended and it is uncertain when they will reopen. During this period, there are various activities take place which are very crucial such as competitive exams and entrance tests of various universities, board examination and semester examinations in universities, nursery school admissions as well as admission process in universities. In order to stop the outbreak of COVID-19, no immediate solution is found out. In India, the closure of school and university will not only have a short-term impact on the continuity of learning of young learners but it will have a large effect on the economic growth of the country as well as having large effect on the society.

                    <p>
                        In order to raise the skills, best public policy tool available is going to school. School is a place where children can have fun and raise social awareness and social skills. The main motive of going school or being in school is that it enhances the ability of the child. Spending a relatively short period of time in school increases skills and ability. On the other side missing the school or not attending the school will have negative effect on the skill growth

                    <p>
                        The closure of the schools has affected the structure of learning and schooling. Firstly, it affected the teaching and assessment methodologies .Online teaching methods are adopted by the few private schools that are handful in taking online classes. In those schools children are taking classes online. On the other side low-income private and government schools have complete closure and not having the access to elearning solution. It is disrupting the learning of students. Parents are facing various issues because of the change in teaching methodology

                    <p>
                        The shutdown of universities has also affected the student’s learning in universities. In order to ensure the continuity in institutes and universities, one immediate measure is essential. To conduct the class smoothly, online teaching methodology is adopted. Learning management software and open-source digital learning solutions are adopted by the universities to run online classes.

                        Higher education is a critical determinant of the economic future of the country and higher education sector has significantly affected by the pandemic as well. Many students from India enroll in universities abroad. Due to the global closure of the institutes and universities, it is expected that it will reduce the demand for the international higher education.

                        Online Classes on Parents In order to maintain the attendance or not missing out too much, children are forced to continue their education at home and generally have not been sent out from the home to play. Bjorklund and Salvanes (2011) described that major inputs into a child’s learning is provided by the families as these are treated as a central to education. Parents are facing issues in understanding the new methodology of teaching. Some parents are not very techno friendly. Thus, they are not able to guide their ward to take classes online. Connectivity of internet is also a big challenge in front of all teachers, students and parents. Many disturbances have to face due to the poor connectivity

                    <p>
                        A key measure to contain the spread of COVID-19, followed by many G20 governments, was to encourage those who can telework from their homes to do so. In order to promote a rapid move to telework for all operations that allow it, countries took a series of measures to simplify its use, including through financial and non-financial support to companies. Italy, for example, simplified the procedure by allowing companies and employees to arrange teleworking without a prior agreement with trade unions, without written agreement and at the employees’ place of choice, while Russia introduced amendments to its Labour Code on teleworking. Spain expedited ongoing public programmes to support the digitalisation of small and medium-sized enterprises.

                    <p>
                        To protect workers who could not work from home, countries often restricted business operations to “essential” services or implemented comprehensive occupational safety and health (OSH) standards. Countries issued stricter sanitary guidelines that ranged from requiring the use of partitioning walls and personal protective equipment (PPE), such as masks, gloves and other protective clothing, to restricting the maximum number of workers allowed to be physically present on companies’ premises. These measures were more challenging to implement in the informal economy where work activities commonly take place in overcrowded areas, such as public spaces, with limited access to hand-washing stations and to PPE

                    <p>
                        Widespread use of sickness benefits and paid sick leave plays an important role in allowing workers to self-isolate and hence controlling the spread of the disease. More generally, it plays a crucial role in supporting workers during a sickness spell: in protecting their incomes, their jobs and their | 23 health. However, paid sick leave can only be an effective tool during the containment, mitigation and postconfinement periods if it is widely available to large parts of the labour force. This was by no means the case in all countries prior to the crisis                    </p>

                    <p>
                        The COVID 19 crisis has increased the demands on many workers to provide family care. During the pandemic, with school and day care closures, reductions in public services for people with disabilities and the elderly, and the non-availability of domestic workers, the hours devoted to care work for many women, as well as men, have increased. Working full hours is often very difficult, if not impossible, under such circumstances, notably for single parents and couples where only one partner can telework. Parents with younger children, who require closer attention, report particular difficulties balancing work and family (Eurofound, 2020[10]). Couples where both parents have to be physically present at their workplace faced an even greater challenge unless child care facilities were provided

                    <p>As the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic sweeps across the world, it is causing widespread concern, fear and stress, all of which are natural and normal reactions to the changing and uncertain situation that everyone finds themselves in.
                    </p>
                    <p>The issue facing each and every one of us is how we manage and react to the stressful situation unfolding so rapidly in our lives and communities. Here we can draw on the remarkable powers of strength and cooperation that we also fortunately possess as humans. And that is what we must try to focus on to respond most effectively to this crisis as individuals, family and community members, friends and colleagues,” said Dr Hans Henri P. Kluge, WHO Regional Director for Europe.
